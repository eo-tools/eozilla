# Wraptile Introduction

Eozilla _Wraptile_ is a server made for wrapping workflow orchestration 
systems with a unified restful API that should be almost compliant
with the [OGC API - Processes](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes).

Wraptile can currently be run with a local execution service or with Airflow.
